This example models a portion of a digital camera. It covers the JPEG 
encoding of a BMP image into a JPEG image. For simplicity the input is 
read from a fixed named file "ccd.bmp" and the output is delivered into
"test.jpg". An additional assumption is that the input image is of fixed 
size: 116x96.

 ref    reference c source code 
 src    SpecC specification model

 make  all     compile and test reference and SpecC specification
