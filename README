EECE 7368 Project 
----------------------

 Overview
 --------
The goal of this project is to convert a reference Lucas Kanade optical flow algorithm to SpecC.  The reference design is located in /ref/ while the SpecC conversion is located in /src/.


 Directory structure
 -------------------

 ref    reference c source code 
 src    SpecC specification model 


 Compilation
 -----------

 make          compile and test SpecC specification
 
 Notes
 ------------------
 
 Depending on your particular experiment you will have to change the file being read in stimulus.sc and the parameters defined in main.sh.

Optical Flow Helper
----------------------

This Java application was built to help us generate results files.  You will need to convert the input image data to a PNG.

* Select the image file you would like to use.  The program will look in the same folder for feature data file.
* In the frame selection text field enter a comma separated list of feature numbers you would like to isolate and view over time.
* The Start and stop filed will let the application know what frames to look at.

If all goes well, a final image, output.png will be generated in the same directory as your executable and will overlay selected feature data onto your image.

This application was built quickly so please pardon the lack of proper error handling.  I highly recommend running it in an IDE like Netbeans if you are having issues.
